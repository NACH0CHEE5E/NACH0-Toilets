# NACH0 Toilets
Adds toilets that your colonists need to use.
you start off with a hole in some dirt and some plumbers. both of these can be made in the workbench
After 15 colonists they start requiring toilets, place one toilet for every 10 colonist and a plumber to clean it, a plumber can clean multiple toilets. for every colonist without a toilet that is clean enough you get a -1 happiness debuff, for every toilet that is to dirty (dirtier than when they dont want to use it) you will get a -2 happiness debuff.
Fancier toilets can be made with technology which provide a further happiness buff.
